# Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Zomato Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implementing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on the Zomato dataset. Zomato is a popular online platform for discovering restaurants and dining options. The dataset provides information about various aspects of restaurants such as location, cuisine, ratings, cost, and more. This README provides an overview of how to conduct EDA and build ML models on the Zomato dataset using Python.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distributions, correlations, and visualizing insights using plots and charts.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Building predictive models for tasks such as restaurant rating prediction, cost prediction, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- **Integration with Python Data Science Libraries**: Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for analysis and modeling.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/zomato-eda-ml.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd zomato-eda-ml
   ```
3. Install required dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the Zomato dataset into your Python environment.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load dataset
   zomato_data = pd.read_csv("zomato_data.csv")
   ```
2. Perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, data cleaning, and feature engineering.
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Build Machine Learning models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
6. Evaluate model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, R-squared score, etc.
7. Fine-tune models and repeat the evaluation process to improve performance if necessary.
8. Deploy the trained models for real-world applications if required.

## Example
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Load dataset
zomato_data = pd.read_csv("zomato_data.csv")

# Data preprocessing steps...

# EDA steps...

# Split dataset into features and target variable
X = zomato_data.drop(columns=['Rating'])
y = zomato_data['Rating']

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
```
